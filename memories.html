    <h3 class ="paragraph-words"> ♡ one of the main reasons i got into web   
    development was because i was extremely dedicated to a tumblr blog a few 
    years ago. i used this blog to vent about everything i was feeling and used 
    it to express myself without keeping anything bottled in. although i am not 
    the same person i was a few years ago, i am still struggling with my mental 
    health and expressing what i'm feeling. this page will be the beginning of 
    me working on myself. i will use this page to write down whatever i feel and 
    use it to do whatever i want ♡ </h3>

    <h3 class = "ballz"> i feel isolated even though i'm not im literally surrounded by friends who love ME!!! WHY!!!!! </h3>

    like this website and finally have the time to play with friends. i really 
    wanna make this website colorful now but that means i have to work on my art
