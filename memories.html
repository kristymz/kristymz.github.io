    <h3 class ="ballz">while i worked hard to make this page a memory column, i decided to remake it into a rant column. one of the main reasons i got into web development was because i was extremely dedicated to a tumblr blog a few years ago. i used this blog to vent about everything i was feeling and used it to express myself without keeping anything bottled in. although i am not the same person i was a few years ago, i am still struggling with my mental health and expressing what i'm feeling.<br> this page will be the beginning of me working on myself. i will use this page to write down what i'm feeling so i can understand it.  </h3>
