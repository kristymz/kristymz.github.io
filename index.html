  <h3 class ="main-text"> hi........ my name is kristy martinez and i'm a high school       senior in long island, NY. this website mainly serves as my personal blog and as a       way to present what i like to the internet. i have been planning what to show to the     world since about 2 years ago (sophomore year). right now, i will be taking those        plans and trying my best to bring them to this website. as i grow as a person in age     and maturity, this website will grow as well. even though my love for computer           science is relatively new compared to those on the internet, this website will also      contain the projects i complete as i go farther in my career. **PS, this website is a    mess currently (most like my life - i finally have time to work on college           
   applications because isaac is home) but please explore it as you like :) this website 
   will evolve with me and it will become MORE COLORFUL!!! </h3>

  <h3 class ="fyi"> *update log* </h3>
  <h3 class ="fyi"> 1/30/22: i decided to start doing an update log cause i might have 
  sorta deleted a good portion of what i was working on before by accident--i really  
  hate how there's no undo tool on repl :( but basically i'm trying to add a starry 
  night background but everytime i follow a tutorial it never works so please bare with 
  me 
  2/2/22: hiii anyone reading this i'm gonna start re-adding the stuff i removed either 
  today or tomorrow or friday. it will probably look ugly at first, but please bare with 
  me. </h3>
